Files include:
- README.md - this file
- album.py - Album class file (should be capitalized)
- cddb.py - Executable that runs the utility
- cddb - The utility source itself
- makefile - makefile for ease of testing

This is a command line utility known as cddb (may have to be run as './cddb').

See below for more details:
```
./cddb -h

The cddb is a utility that keeps a flat file database of cd entries

Options:
    -l, --list-album    Displays a list of albums
    -d, --delete-album    Deletes album entry from database
    -a, --add-album    Adds album entry to database
    -h, --usage        Displays use message and quits utility
```

This is just an exercise.
